# WordBlitzExecutor
A program that plays the facebook game "WordBlitz" - consistently with an average of 99% of words per round. This program by far beats any other WordBlitz bot that I know of.

I DO NOT ENDORSE CHEATING IN THE GAME WORDBLITZ - This program is intended to be used for fun, not against unknowing players.


The English vocabulary "sowpods.txt" should be used for highest average. The Swedish vocabulary beats all players so far but no average score has been tested.

------------------------------------------------------------------ Game Instructions ----------------------------------------------------
Follow the instructions from the command line when running.

After starting a round in WordBlitz please enter the play-field letter by letter in the string FIELD = "your field" in the top of the Main - column by column.

After entering, run the program and put the mouse on the top left letter and when the program asks you, put it in the top right. You may change the sleep-time in the Main-class if theres not enough time to put your mouse properly.

Now the program should start Blitzing away - please don't touch the mouse when it runs, but if you by accident do so it shouldn't affect the success of the program.

You may import new vocabularies as long as they are in the same form as the existing ones - or add missing words in existing vocabularies.
